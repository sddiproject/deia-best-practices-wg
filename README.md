# Framework of DEIA best practices

The purpose of this group is to make evidence-based recommendations for DEIA practices in open source. We take a look at what DEIA practices have been tried and whether it has worked or not. We follow an evidence based approach to back-up our recommendations with research. We explicitly incorporate Activation (the A in DEIA) in our approach to move beyond the conversation to drive lasting impact.

Goals of the WG are:

1. Compile DEIA best practices in open source, structured in a framework
2. Conduct a survey and interviews, to evaluate and complete the framework of DEI best practices in open source

Non-goals of the WG are:

1. Assess the state of DEIA in open source
2. Discuss the current problems concerning DEIA in open source
3. Coach an open source project on their DEIA practices

## Deliverables

1. Survey results that show what DEIA practices work and donâ€™t work
2. Create a resource for open source to learn about DEIA best practices (and what not to try)
3. Publish an academic research paper
4. Facilitate popularizing our findings
5. Create a digital research library
